Hey there, I'm Mark. I'm a developer, trader, and entrepenuer. 

## What Do I Do?
Currently, I'm a web developer at ASI, but we wear many hats. I also build trading systems and strategies in NodeJS and Python. You can check out my other projects in the Projects page. 

## Who Is This Guy?
I want to be the best like no one ever was. Maybe I'll change the world, but I'll settle for doing something meaningful. 

## What Else?
I love beer (responsibly). Both Grand Rapids and Tampa have had amazing breweries and I love trying them all. I play bass and guitar, but I'm not in a band (yet). I'm a gamer and proud. My nerding abilities are off the charts. Fantasy Football Champion 2014 & 2015. Time's Person of the Year 2006.
